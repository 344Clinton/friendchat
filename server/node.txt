How to node.js

IMPORTANT : If you are switching node version, you must rebuild node_modules directory:
	1. remove <hello-server-dir>/node_modules
	2. > npm install
	3. if any of the modules threw an error, do once:
		> npm rebuild
		
	4. if you still have errors, you may now commence panicing.


INSTALL : 
n is a version manager for node, very useful. Follow instruction here
	https://github.com/tj/n
	
v4.4.4 is lowest version tested and the one that plays nice(r) with the node-inspector debugger.
Using latest stable vesion ( like 6.x.x ) is probably fine aswell.

Following defaults might get you a version different from v4.4.4 ( like 6.x.x ). Check with
	> node -v
If this is the case
	> n 4.4.4
will install and switch to the correct version


NPM MISSING : 
Your node installation is old and/or screwed up, remove node and GOTO INSTALL
